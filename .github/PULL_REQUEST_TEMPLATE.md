# [Ticket / Issue Number: TICKET_NUMBER_OR_ID](INSERT_TICKET_LINK)

## 🧠 This is the problem my PR is trying to address:
Every code change should be solving a problem, big or small.

As product-oriented engineers, our responsibility covers not only the code we produce, but also the pain points we can get rid of for our clients, end-users, as well as other members in the team.

✅ Problem -> Code -> Solution

❌ Code -> IDK what's this for
